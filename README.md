# HackBeyondLimitsWebsiteCollection

## 📌 Project Overview
The **HackBeyondLimitsWebsiteCollection** is a repository that stores different versions of our hackathon website. This collection allows us to track the progress and improvements made to our website over time, showcasing different iterations and design updates.  

## 📂 Repository Structure
The repository contains multiple versions of the hackathon website, each stored in its own folder or branch. Below is a suggested structure:  

```

Each version represents a different stage of development, allowing easy comparison and access to previous versions.
